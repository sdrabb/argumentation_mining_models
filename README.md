# Argumentation Mining Models

This repository provides three types of Neural Networks that can be used to solve the Context Independent Claim Detection.
We employ our models on the  [IBM dataset](http://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml) and for each of them we consider the pretrained word embeddings built with [*Glove model*](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)


## Repository Structure
* [LSTM](https://github.com/sdrabb/argumentation_mining_models/tree/master/lstm) implementation of the *LSTM*: the model is defined in the file **lstm.py** 



## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - *Long Short Term Memory* and *Recursive Neural Network*
* [Torch](http://torch.ch/) - *Tree Structured Long Short Term Memory*
