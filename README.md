# Argumentation Mining Models

This repository provides three types of Neural Networks that can be used to solve the Context Independent Claim Detection.
We employ our models on the * [IBM dataset](http://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml) and for each of them we consider the pretrained word embeddings built with [*Glove model*](http://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml)


## Repository Structure



## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - *Long Short Term Memory* and *Recursive Neural Network*
* [Torch](http://torch.ch/) - *Tree Structured Long Short Term Memory*
